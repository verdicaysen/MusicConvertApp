Console.Beep Music Generator

This application reads a list of musical notes and durations from an input text file and generates a C# program that uses Console.Beep to play the specified notes.
How to Use
Step 1: Prepare the Input File

Create a text file named notes.txt in the same directory as the application. Each line in this file should specify a note, its duration, and the tempo (in BPM) separated by spaces. The format is:

php

<Note> <Duration> <BPM>

Notes

The note should be a valid musical note from C0 to C8. Use the following format:

    Natural notes: C4, D4, E4, etc.
    Sharp/Flat notes: C#4 or Db4 (use either # or b notation)

Durations

The duration should be one of the following:

    whole (4 beats)
    half (2 beats)
    quarter (1 beat)
    eighth (0.5 beats)
    sixteenth (0.25 beats)

BPM (Beats Per Minute)

Specify the tempo in BPM (e.g., 120).
Example notes.txt File

C4 quarter 120
D4 half 120
E4 quarter 120
F4 whole 120
G4 eighth 120
A4 sixteenth 120
B4 quarter 120

Step 2: Run the Application

    Ensure you have the notes.txt file with the correct format in the same directory as your application.
    Compile and run the application.

Step 3: Check the Generated File

The application will read the notes.txt file and generate a C# program saved as GeneratedBeep.cs in the same directory. This file will contain the Console.Beep commands corresponding to the notes specified in notes.txt.
Example of GeneratedBeep.cs

csharp

using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.Beep(262, 500); // C4 quarter note at 120 BPM
        Console.Beep(294, 1000); // D4 half note at 120 BPM
        Console.Beep(330, 500); // E4 quarter note at 120 BPM
        Console.Beep(349, 2000); // F4 whole note at 120 BPM
        Console.Beep(392, 250); // G4 eighth note at 120 BPM
        Console.Beep(440, 125); // A4 sixteenth note at 120 BPM
        Console.Beep(494, 500); // B4 quarter note at 120 BPM
    }
}

Additional Notes

    The application includes a full range of musical notes from C0 to C8.
    If a note is not found in the dictionary, a warning message will be displayed, but the application will continue processing other notes.
    Ensure that each line in the notes.txt file follows the correct format to avoid errors.
